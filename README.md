PROJECT TITLE:Analysis and predection of Malls customer.cs file of american Mall market called as phonex mall, find out on basis of client requriments of dendograms using scipy graphics library with the help of "scipy cluster. hierarchy to ace the number of linkage of clustering to predecit

PROBLEM STATEMENT: The american finance market clients as per the rate od GDP of 2011 found as highest number of growth in there business market. As a datascience engineer find out which hierarchy cluster give maximum linkage in upcoming future

TASKS
Task-1: With help of sipcy library import the library and import datasets.
Task-2: Using the dendrogram to find the optimal number of clusters.
Task-3 Create a hirerachy model and viuliaze the cluster with help of matplot library.

Conclusion: According to model buliding as a engineer my prediction is cluster number 3 has give highest number of linkage

INSIGHTS:

Cluster-1 contains {red} which shows that unsupervised learning cluster has maximum ucliding distance from the centroid up to annual income approximate 139ks.

Cluster-2: Cluster 2 contains {blue} which shows that unsupervised learning cluster as maximum ucliding distance from centroid up to annual income approximately 79 t0 80ks.

Cluster-3: Cluster 3 contains (orange} which shows that unsupervised learning cluster as maximum ucliding distance from centroid up to annual income approximately 139ks.

Cluster-4: Cluster 3 contains {green} color which shows that unsupervised learning cluster has maximum ucliding distance from the centriod upto annual income appropriate 140ks.

Cluster-5: Cluster 3 contains {cyan} color which shows that unsupervised learning cluster has maximum ucliding distance from the centriod upto annual income appropriate 41ks.
